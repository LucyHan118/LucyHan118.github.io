           <p>
           If the enslaved people in the 1860s had the technology that we have today, 
           we would have been able to stop the spread of slavery. Black people can 
           communicate using their phones and talk to their families over Zoom 
           about their experience in America and how they have been treated by 
           the people there. If they are being treated unequally or unfairly, 
           black people can post on social media to ask for help. Since information 
           spreads quickly online and people in the North can support them both 
           online and in real life, so there would be very little slavery in the US. 
           The north officers can also use the internet to spread the message of 
           abandon Slavery, which would stop the spread of slavery.
