           Put all of the info about slavery and background of time period; rights of a human being,
           If the people at that time have the technology that we have today, they would be able to stop 
           slavery even before it happens. Black people can communicate using their phones and talk to their 
           families over Zoom about their experience in America and how they have been treated by the 
           people there. If they are being treated unequally or unfairly, black people can post on social 
           media to ask for help. Since information spread quickly online, and people in the North can 
           support them both online and in real life, so there would be very less slavery in the US. The 
           north officers can also use the internet to spread the message of abandon Slavery, which would
           end slavery before it even begins.
