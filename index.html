           If the enslaved people in the 1860s had the technology that we have today, 
           we would have been able to stop the spread of slavery. African Americans can 
           communicate using their phones and talk to their families over Zoom 
           about their experience in America and how they have been treated by 
           the people there. With the idea of mass communication and the internet, enslaved people would have found it easier to find resources to escape and achieve freedom.
